This file is more of a reminder to myself.

In order for this to work each folder needs to have a Markdown file with the same name as the closest encapsulating directory. In this directory there must be a PNG called "t_{name}.png". There must also be a text file called "r_{name}.txt", which contains only a single integer in the range from 0 to 10.

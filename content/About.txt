This file is more of a reminder to myself.

For reviews:
In order for this to work each folder needs to have a Markdown file with the same name as the closest encapsulating directory. In this directory there must be a PNG called "t_{name}.png". There must also be a text file called "r_{name}.txt", which contains only a single integer in the range from 0 to 10.

Rating names:

For creative:
Creative is the simplest page. Only a markdown file with an identical name is required. These pages are used for e.g. artwork and other design related things.

For about:
Used for biography and publication abstract including the link. Requires a markdown file with the same name, and another markdown file named "i_{name}.md". The additional markdown file is used for additional information.

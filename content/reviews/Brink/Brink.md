# Brink game review

## Introduction
Brink was released in May 2011 after a long, carefully executed marketing campaign. It is developed by Splash Damage and published by Bethesda Softworks. The engine used was the late id Tech 4 engine (Doom 3 engine). Upon initial reception the game was met with middling reviews, specifically more unfavorably on the end of the consumers. The general consensus was the game did not live up to the marketing material and was not in a complete working state. Plagued by poor performance on common systems, questionable net-code, mediocre game-feel and a strangely implemented progression system the game found itself in a rapid decline mere weeks after launch.

Looking back on Brink in 2023 makes it a fascinating trainwreck of poor planning, inconsistent execution and overhyping to caricatural degrees. But not all is bad: despite it's extremely flawed presentation Brink stands as a unique, rather daring product that falls in-line with Splash Damage's previous and subsequent works. Brink can, as of writing this article, still be purchased on Steam. It is only playable locally or through peer to peer.

## The premise
Before even announcing Brink Splash Damage was known for games like *Wolfenstein : Enemy Territory* and, to a much lesser degree *Enemy Territory: Quake Wars* (another John Carmack game, also made with the id Tech 4 engine).

# Brink(2011) game review

## Introduction
Brink was released in May 2011 after a long, carefully executed marketing campaign. It is developed by Splash Damage and published by Bethesda Softworks. The engine used was the late id Tech 4 engine (Doom 3 engine). Upon initial reception the game was met with middling reviews, specifically more unfavorably on the end of the consumers. The general consensus was the game did not live up to the marketing material and was not in a complete working state. Plagued by poor performance on common systems, questionable net-code, mediocre game-feel and a strangely implemented progression system the game found itself in a rapid decline mere weeks after launch.

Looking back on Brink in 2023 makes it a fascinating trainwreck of poor planning, inconsistent execution and overhyping to caricatural degrees. But not all is bad: even though extraordinarily flawed Brink does stand as a unique, rather daring product that falls in-line with Splash Damage's previous and subsequent works. Brink can, as of writing this article, still be obtained on Steam, entirely for free. It is only playable locally or through peer to peer.

## Tl:dr
Albeit bold, Brink does not deliver on the premise the developers were striving for. It is an almost objectively inferior version of Splash Damage's later *Dirty Bomb* (now also defunct). It's movement system, even though mostly functional, is neither satisfying as tactical- nor movement shooter. The visual style is distinct and bold, but the texture work remains inconsistent at best. The map design is stagnant and does not justify the size of most maps. Body types feel awkwardly balanced, leaving especially the medium class without options. The progression system is very hostile towards new players, allowing for various direct upgrades to be obtained over time (including locking body types behind an XP wall). The objectives destroy proper pacing in most matches and the fact that both teams converge on them most of the match invalidates the "parkour" aspect the game was promoted with.

Despite its shortcomings Brink is worth trying and sets the stage for much better games. Many things the game commits to might have worked on paper, but got lost in the confusion between the design document and the actual implementation. The strongest point of Brink is in its presentation, with decent sound design, clean menus, plenty of cosmetic items and a distinct, rugged look.

**Verdict: 4/10 - "mediocre"**

## The premise
Before even announcing Brink Splash Damage was known for games like *Wolfenstein : Enemy Territory* and, to a much lesser degree *Enemy Territory: Quake Wars* (another John Carmack game, also made with the id Tech 4 engine).

## Introduction

GRIME is a game developed by Clover Bite and published by Akupara Games. It first released as a Windows exclusive in August 2021, with releases for Playstation and Xbox following in December 2022. Another year later the game released on the Nintendo Switch in January of 2024. The game was developed in the Unity Engine. The game received several large, free updates after it released - significantly enhancing the base game's content. GRIME is a metroidvania. Its inspirations are vast [according to game director Yarder Weissbrot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cooNJQx1l2M) but significant works include Wayne Barlowe, Bloodborne and Akira.

Upon launch Grime was met with positive reviews from consumers and critics alike. It sits at a comfortable 86% user review score on Steam at the time of writing. A sequel called ["GRIME II"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-cnb4y44WQ) is expected to launch somewhere later this year.

## A metroidvania inspired by the soulsbornes

If I had a penny... In various interviews with game director Yarder Weissbrot it becomes immediately evident the soulsbornes played a significant role in GRIME's design process. But even if it weren't for them admitting to it the inspiration resonates all throughout the game. This continues to be a double edged sword not merely from a creative standpoint, but in particular the propagation of feeling it is *totally okay* to waive accessibility features. GRIME did not prove immune to this effect and loves to make things difficult for the player by obfuscating the challenge. It does so through classic, dated design choices like disallowing the player to advance in absence from a specific "yet to be unveiled!"-ability that have become synonymous with metroidvanias, but also invents its own annoyances like depriving the player of a map until they find a hidden beacon. When it comes to the soulsbornes it's *ye olde formula* again: the player needs to read some arbitrary animation to leverage the parry and dodge mechanic. Even though this design choice has become a "souls-like" (and, to be frank, also metroidvania) staple in the last decade it continues to feel cheap and underdeveloped to me; the player has no logical starting point to reason from. Why does this Rock creature take but 3 frames to cave my head in, but that much more imposing amalgamation over there needs a whole runway? It is a classic example of *difficulty through inaccessibility*; something I simply cannot and probably never will appreciate. Its efficacy in allowing for an expressive pool of enemies continues to be unrivaled however - something GRIME makes good use of.

Fortunately GRIME does take communication immediately tied to unique core mechanics quite seriously. The player is to parry enemies; immediately depleting the *current red* health segment of any foe caught off-guard and yielding some *breath* for the player (indirect healing). Enemies that do not display a flashing red hue during their windup frames can be parried. Enemies that do not display a red health bar will merely be momentarily disoriented instead upon being parried, effectively incentivizing the player to take a different approach until the corresponding segment is dealt with. The game later expands the core mechanics by adding the "pull"-ability. Various enemies are vulnerable to being pulled, usually rewarding the player with a sizeable window to punish a foe "pulled". A foe or target susceptible to pulling is indicated with a bright yellow hue. The communication in this department is strong and leaves little to interpret for the player. The color pops up? React accordingly.

Looping back to an earlier complaint: the game's love for disorienting the player by starving them of important information. This is another soulsborne classic, with a nice sprinkle of excessive, pointless backtracking honoring decades old SNES games. The effect of these annoyances is superficial *padding*, even incentivizing the player ignores everything in their path. Having to clear the same area several times over is not fun, just like repeating the same puzzle ten times over is not. Not even in the name of "adventure" or "respecting the players' intelligence". It took GRIME several hours before finally submitting to my exasperated moaning and allowing for a *fast travel* option - even if still quite limited.

## Sidescrolling to full potential

Decades upon decades of sidescrollers have not been lost on the designers of GRIME as the game effortlessly incorporates genre classics in novel ways, allowing for not just extraordinary boss fights but also excellent *platforming* sections. Rather than introducing a plethora of gimmicks GRIME prefers to elaborate as far as it can on its core set of mechanics. The effect is a game that feels coherent, understandable and *rewarding*: the player gets *better* at what they have been doing as they progress. Not all core mechanics hit the mark for me however - most notably Ardor feels underutilized and rather arbitrary (double negative feedback for bad players, again).

The boss-fights are the definite highlight in GRIME. Being a sidescroller even the most intimidating amalgamations fit entirely on the player's screen (please do take notes Miyazaki). Most bosses are sufficiently static that the player has little to no trouble determining what regions of the screen are to be avoided - even during the most hectic of fights. Rather GRIME tries to progressively *overload* the player with things going on. Even though it does not hit the mark perfectly the game does an overall good job at communicating the challenge. This effectively makes the game feel *fair*; the player could see that enormous appendage clubbing them on the head coming. It was *their fault they got hit*. Much of the difficulty in GRIME arises from juggling urgent information and your *stamina-bar* - the latter of which the game utilizes excellently.

And if you think the comparatively limited amount of mechanics GRIME introduces wouldn't allow for some spectacular boss-fights you have got a thing or two coming. Especially the final boss, despite being both hard and punishing, felt like a masterclass in boss design.

Platforming in GRIME feels snappy and responsive, starting off simple but much more demanding as the game progresses. As mentioned previously the game is surprising in how little it relies on gimmicks - mostly utilizing platforming classics to express its challenges. Sometimes less is simply more. Despite feeling quite flat initially later sections will have the player fly through various obstacles, "pulling" themselves across seas of lethal spikes. Similar to the rest of the game the difficulty steadily ramps up as the player becomes more accustomed to their tool-set. It, to my great relief, never becomes sardonic in its difficulty, unlike some of its peers... (Hollow Knight)

## More tools, for less consistency

An adventure game at heart GRIME *obviously* needed a vast selection of equipment. How else are we to incentivize the player to look in all equally disgusting nooks and crannies the world offers? Unfortunately spreading a wide net usually yields an inconsistent experience across the playerbase rather than a streamlined one. "Just don't use that weapon, it sucks against this boss" is commentary I don't want to read, but unfortunately did quite a few times while reading guides for GRIME. But luckily we are equipped with a second (totally rudimentary from a gameplay perspective) weapon-slot! Great, had it not been for the fact the game also offers a weapon-upgrade system that demands the investment of finite resources.

Equipment in GRIME feels like it is implemented just to follow the boilerplate, and the effect this achieves is exactly as you would expect it to: unfit for the context. As the player progresses they will run into many different pieces of armor and weapons alike, most of which are discarded mentally upon seeing them. They do not fit your *play-style*; something determined far prior to discovering these rudimentary tools. This is further flattened by the fact the game expects you to gradually invest in specific pieces. Are you *really* going to re-run that dungeon for the fourth time just to try this funny looking knife you just obtained? Even in bigger triple A titles, most notably any of the soulsbornes, this lead to a very inconsistent experience.

The same problem is enhanced by the way power progression is implemented outside weapon upgrades. Weapons have a specific affinity tied to them, something the player might or *might just not* have leveled up. Respeccing is rare in GRIME too, making the array of equipment feel even more rigid and frankly unnecessary. Leveling stats also becomes obfuscated by the fact *the player might not yet know what equipment they want to wield* - forcing the use of an external wiki page and partially ruining the element of discovery. Overall GRIME might have benefitted from containing itself a little.

## Conclusion

GRIME is a game oozing with as much passion as it does other unidentified fluids. With its body-horror inspired aesthetic it is not a look you will forget any time soon. Unfortunately the game fails to innovate much on genres it takes inspiration from, instead opting to blatantly copy many of their flaws. On the flip-side GRIME knows its niche, and when it does take responsibility it reaches surprising heights. Glued together with excellent sound design across the board, an enthralling story and unique world building GRIME stands as a truly unforgettable experience - even if flawed.

**Verdict: 7/10 - "good"**

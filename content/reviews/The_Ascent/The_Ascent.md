**Small note:** The Ascent offers a multiplayer option outside singleplayer as well. I have *not played this mode*, but I have heard from several people it is prone to various issues!

## Introduction
The Ascent was released in 2021 for both Windows and Xbox after an [exclusivity deal was signed with Microsoft](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-ascent-became-an-xbox-series-x-launch-exclusive-ign-first) about two years prior. Playstation releases followed a year later. The game was developed by Neon Giant, based in Sweden. Consisting of a comparatively small team of 12 people The Ascent set some extremely lofty goals for itself. Fortunately the company had the experience to back it up. The engine used is the Unreal Engine 4. It is an ARPG Twin-Stick shooter by design, even though the RPG elements take a backseat to the story. Upon release the game was met with favorable reviews from critics, but received a mixed reception from consumers - primarily due to performance related issues.

Being in development at the same time, The Ascent shares a lot of aesthetic similarities with Cyberpunk 2077, released a few months prior. The Ascent takes place in an more advanced, higher sci-fi and even cruder dystopian hellscape passing for a future. You are put in the shoes of a lowly thug, trying to navigate a world dominated by corporate overlords.

## The good
Being an ARPG and Twin-Stick shooter at heart The Ascent is immediately tasked with battling some of the genre's prominent issues: having to find a solution for the usual "backstrafe and funnel enemies into a straight line" strategy and the general monotony of combat (needless to say related issues). The game does a decent job at this, offering a dynamic spawning system that will cause enemies to appear from various places at all angles from the player's current position. This effectively forces them to try and find the "escape vector" or hole in the enemy formation. On top of this the player gets access to two tactical options: augments and "tactical tools"; both offering some form of combat utility. The latter is charged through inflicting damage to hostiles, effectively rewarding *speed* - which is something I personally appreciate.

But better yet is the game's cover system: with a button press the player alternates between crouching and standing. With another they raise their weapon or hold it at the hip. Combining crouching and firing high allows you to take cover from incoming fire while returning your own from relative safety. Raising your weapon while standing causes hit enemies to flinch, offering you ample opportunity to take out isolated targets in a fair fight. This at the cost of reduced mobility. As the game throws both ranged, melee and "tactically oriented" (mortars and the likes) enemies your way each permutation has its own purpose. The cover mechanic also gives meaning to *a lot* of geometry that is "just there" in similar ARPGs. Disappointingly the game does not do a very good job at implementing cover in a consistent way, and I frequently found myself shooting the geometry despite my laser sight suggesting it would not. It is a simple, somewhat flawed but incredibly expressive implementation I would love to see refined.

Visually The Ascent is a delight, assuming you don't get exposed to the models or textures up too close. Environs are coherent thematically, yet elaborate enough to inspire a sense of awe. The color palettes are unsurprising; contrasting metal to emission shaders in the form of neon signs or electric currents. The game does an excellent job at conveying the overpopulated hodgepodge of a world the story takes place in, with literal *hundreds* of NPCs decorating the heavily inhabited sections of the map. All aforementioned NPCs are subjected to the same satisfying gore system enemies are, and will flee upon being exposed to nearby gunfire. It is a marvel of optimization the game runs as consistently as it does. It vaguely reminds me of the Burst Compiler demos Unity put out in years past. The game is something to behold when at its best.

Sound-design wise the game is equally impressive, sporting unsurprising but serviceable music and excellent sound effects. Weapons sound positively brutal and offer as much oomph as you could reasonable expect from a top-down game. Combined with the pretty particle effects the game manages to achieve that coveted "visceral" feel with ease.

## The questionable
The story The Ascent tells feels like it cast itself into a limbo between elaborate yet way too over-exploited to be interesting. The cyberpunk theme saw a significant influx of material surrounding, well... Cyberpunk 2077's release. This was much to the Ascent's detriment, and is frequently reflected in various critic reviews I read. Especially when looking at the Codex and the various races carving out their own niche in the world it becomes apparent a lot of time went into creating the setting what it is from a narrative standpoint. Unfortunately I found myself bored with the monotony of it quite quickly. The main storyline does little to alleviate this either, being tonally in-line with the remainder of the game. Disappointing, as the game offers excellent voice acting work across the board and pretty well written characters.

Being a game developed by a comparatively small team it shouldn't be expected the game would offer a huge amount of content. I would say The Ascent *exceeds* expectations in this regard, but not enough to make the loot system interesting in any way. Enemies will drop the same two weapons over and over, and the occasional texture change to my tank top failed to peak my interest either. On top of purely cosmetic items the game offers an equipment system which is much too cumbersome and awkward to find much joy in. Looting felt more like a chore than a delight despite the game clearly committing to it. For many ARPGs this would be a death sentence, but fortunately The Ascent has stronger fundamentals than most.

Another pattern you will find in consumer reviews is that the game's UX is somewhat unpleasant, with awkward menus, unclear objectives and a difficult to comprehend map. Admittedly this did not resonate with me in the first few hours, but as I continued I found myself agreeing more with this sentiment gradually. The menus, especially for equipment is inadequate; the player is presented with merely the dry stats of each weapon or piece of clothing without much information to go on. From a cosmetic point of view this is obnoxious, as you would have to alternate between closing out the menu and re-entering it if you would want to get a jazzy outfit going. But much worse is the fact the game just does not properly tutorialize various statistics, such as *damage types* and *spread recovery* (a stat I've seen many posts about with people being utterly confused what this actually does - which is quite awful considering a skill is tied to it directly). These are explained in textual form in the Codex, but this hardly passes as acceptable nowadays. Missions fall victim to being confusing quite frequently as well - usually concluding in some form of "we will contact you"; leaving the player entirely devoid of any objectives to pursue. These quests often continue upon leaving the encapsulating area, but I can understand this to be a source of agitation.

Being a Twin-Stick shooter and ARPG the game suffers the classic problem of not quite being expressive enough to justify many side-quests. Unfortunately The Ascent does not embrace this and I found myself exceedingly bored with those available to me - being very generic and bland in nature. This problem is further enhanced by the fact the narrative aspect is not the game's strongest point. Fortunately side quests can be ignored by design, so I can't really call this a true con (even though the effort could, and should have been used in other facets of the game).

Initially the game communicates itself quite well visually and I found myself only very rarely conflicted about what targets to attack or areas to avoid. There is a bit of deliberate ambiguity involved surrounding civilians, which you might shoot by accident confusing them for enemies in the heat of the moment (don't worry, this is not punished outside an occasional quip). The minimap implementation is solid and I found myself using it consistently throughout my playtime. The color coding is okay-ish, even though enemies sometimes fall away against the backdrop a bit more than I would like. Unfortunately, like most things in The Ascent, this starts to deteriorate very quickly as playtime progresses. Especially in the later stages of the game the screen becomes increasingly hard to read with an abundance of particles flying around.

## The bad
I had to consider what score to assign The Ascent for quite a while, but in the end I found myself counting too many flaws to give it any higher than a 7 in spite of the clear amount of effort, expertise and passion that went into making it. Considering how much the game descents into being a generic, rather trashy ARPG in the later stages that feels more than fair.

Being an ARPG The Ascent falls victim to many of the genre's common flaws. The player can freely walk into territories populated by *overleveled* enemies, killing the player instantly. Conversely the game implements damage scaling in such a way the player is not entirely incapable of taking these enemies on, which leads to another problem: the player unintentionally *overleveling themselves*. But arguably even more comically these enemies may drop pieces of equipment that are ridiculously overpowered considering the player's current level. This effectively turns them into nigh invincible juggernauts not having to care in the slightest about getting shot by weaker enemies. At this point the challenge pretty much evaporates. This effectively ruined three subsequent main missions for me despite already playing on the hardest difficulty. More tangentially this also invalidates a lot of loot the player might receive during missions.

As mentioned in the "good" section I very much enjoy the cover system, but again the game does way too little to incentivize actually using it. Just developing an understanding of how to *build* your character can carry you through even the toughest sections of the game with ease. In my eyes holding the left mouse button while mowing down enemies in an orgy of particles hardly constitutes gameplay or a challenge, and as such this is a definite negative for me. This problem starts to become more prominent as the game progresses - eventually decaying in the typical whirlwind of particles we've come to expect from the genre.

The build system itself mostly consists of giving the player the option to invest in a certain facet of the game, rather than locking them out of certain mechanics entirely. I have seen this applied before, but it does not solve the problem as neatly as some designers seem to think it does; even with comparatively gradual steps these upgrades will amount to the player effectively primarily using a specific set of tools. This hurts the expressiveness of the game in the long run and almost innately guarantees the experience is going to be inconsistent across different players. It is a compromise between between consistency and offering the players the macro/role playing aspect of varying builds but does not excel at either.

I simply can't agree with some of the game's implementations. Many weapons and enemies incentivize disregarding the fundamentals the game teaches you by either actively rewarding or forcing you to position yourself in such a way damage is pretty much unavoidable. This quickly devolves to the earlier problem I described of having a very little dynamic game of mostly just holding down the mouse button, sprinkled with the occasional use of your "tactical tool". The game fails to give rise to many ad hoc tactical decision and feels rather mindless, amplified even more as the player progresses.

Outside of health there is a bar dedicated to a "mana-like" resource used for augments (really just abilities on a cooldown). This resources generates over-time rather than by inflicting damage, or some item that is dropped at random. This is a classic design mistake in my eyes, as it *rewards* the player for waiting around. Instead of engaging the next cluster of enemies they might actually increase their chances of winning by idling and letting this meter fill back up. An odd choice, considering the other tactical tool *does* regenerate by engaging.

Lastly but certainly not least there is the concern of the bugs and performance issues. I personally did not suffer *any* performance or stability issues, which might lead to this game being rated far too favorably here for some people. I did however experience a few bugs such as questlines pointing me to the wrong location or the map, or needing to restart the game to trigger a cutscene that refused to play. Overall I encountered only comparatively minor problems in this regard.

## Conclusion
The Ascent is a very pretty, mature ARPG Twin-Stick shooter set in a thematically over-exploited setting. Even though it starts off strong, the game does fall victim to becoming mindless, hard to read and exceedingly dull as it progresses. The world is vaguely elaborate yet doesn't feel original enough for me to be enthralled with. Excellent sound design, beautiful visuals and strong fundamentals make The Ascent a title worth playing, but only if you are a fan of ARPGs. That is, as long as you can take in stride the boring loot system, sub par UX and lack of build variety.

**Verdict: 7/10 - "good"**

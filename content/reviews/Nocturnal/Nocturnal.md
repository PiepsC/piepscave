## Introduction

Nocturnal is a very small production developed by Sunnyside Games and published by Dear Villagers. The company is Switzerland based, focusing primarily on 2d, "art driven games". It is developed in the Unity engine and released in 2023. It is an action platformer inspired by Prince of Persia. The game achieved very little traction since launching on Steam, sitting at 85 user reviews at the time of writing. It's reception was positive, achieving good ratings from both consumers and critics alike. It received the "Best Entertainment Game" at SWIGA 2023. A few months after its initial release it received a substantial update to the underlying mechanics.

## The premise

Nocturnal is a very short game, lasting an intended three hours. It took me approximately 2,5 hours to complete from start to finish in a single sitting. Even though it is narrative driven the approach to storytelling is, once again indirect; conveyed primarily through brief one-sided dialogue and notes. Being an action platformer the game is straightforward, interweaving combat sections with platforming puzzles. The highlight lies within its primary gimmick: the mist. The mist is the source of your peril (for a large array of reasons, a lot of which unfortunately unintended) and is portrayed as fumes of real-time simulated fluids/gasses. It is an impressive effect, especially when the game starts throwing collisions into the mix. To battle the mist you are equipped with fire. Interacting with sources of fire sets your sword ablaze, giving you a dwindling window of opportunity - including the ability to pierce the mist or perform exclusive combat maneuvers. It is also the driving mechanic behind most of the game's puzzles.

Being a self-proclaimed "art driven game" the game sports a pleasing graphical design, consisting of simple geometric forms enhanced with impressive shading effects. Characters are the most simplistic, featuring brighter colors in a very limited color palette arranged in simple strokes (similar to games like Hollow Knight this is undoubtedly a deliberate choice to facilitate easier animation).  Nocturnal's visual appeal is without a doubt one if its strongest points.

## Simply flawed

Out of all games I played in 2023 Nocturnal has to be one of the most flawed. Somewhat surprising considering how simple the premise is and how confidently it presents itself on first glance.

As described in the previous section the game revolves around its primary dualistic gimmick of Mist and Fire. Mist represented by a thick, suffocating fog-like substance and fire its antithesis: radiant and resourceful. In order to proceed the player is often tasked with lighting various braziers or torches, whereas letting the mist keep a present results in the player either slowly perishing, or rather rapidly at the hands of the various foes spawned from it. This formula works quite well when in various of its implementations, but goes complete against the genre's responsibilities when it does not. Enemies spawned from the mist sport a simple, flat color palette consisting of predominantly black - matching the color of the fog. This effectively obfuscates the visual communication in a mostly reaction based game, making the game feel frustrating at the worst of times and clunky and inconsistent at best. The issue is further accentuated by the rather careless use of particle effects. The game suffered a similar issue before it was updated in the form of various platforming sections shrouded in darkness. Fortunately this was addressed. In a game that demands precise input communication should be prioritized rather than be made deliberately opaque.

Unfortunately this is far from the game's only flaw. Even though Nocturnal shows occasional genius its combat is by far its weakest aspect. Ironically the game communicates combat quite well when the player is not faced with creatures spawned from the mist; opting for distinct, simple to recognize color palettes and shapes, with both a visual and audio cue for individual attacks. Especially the boss fights are readable and feel like they give plenty of room for the player to learn from their mistakes. The flow of the combat however feels flat, while making very little use of the game's core gimmick. During combat sections the player can opt to either dodge or parry incoming attacks while being able to punish the assailant in their cooldown phase. There seems to be no particular intended pace, as the player is also equipped with various powers on flat cooldowns (which, in my opinion, is a classic mistake in a game that wants to reward speed). Exclusive combat features are frequently tied to having access to fire, but this is either a complete necessity or merely a tangential boon (albeit admittedly a huge one) - depending on the current enemies. Despite showing moderate signs of creativity in the design of some of the puzzles, the combat does not take it anywhere surprising.

Implementation wise combat suffers even more issues, particularly struggling to provide proper, consistent feedback. Nocturnal opts for the questionable choice of enemies being able to stun the player character for a considerable amount of time, often making the game feel unresponsive and unfair. Enemies can take large quantities of damage while making it difficult to keep track of their current health bar. Combined with the aforementioned lack of visual clarity the game starts to feel very inconsistent until the player brute forces their way over the familiarity barrier.

At best combat feels bland, at worst hard to read and inconsistent.

Outside its flawed premise Nocturnal is a *serviceable at best* platformer, offering very little outside the bare bones you would expect. The game does neither feel smooth nor jarring in its approach to movement. Traversal mechanics are limited to a handful core mechanics, including jumping, dodge rolling, throwing a projectile and "extended jumps" by performing aerial attacks. This limits the expressiveness of most of its platforming sections. Fortunately the game does still have access to its core gimmicks and makes *occasional* good use of them. By far Nocturnal's strongest sections are those that require you to light various braziers on the fly, either while a collapsing ceiling trap is breathing down your neck or your only light source is attached to a set trajectory. At no point did the game surprise me with its ingenuity, but it did feel different and quite unique at the best of times. Mist itself is rather under-utilized as a mechanic and frequently serves more as deliberate, but very poorly implemented visual ambiguity. Occasionally the player might succumb to it over a set timer, but this practically only occurs when they are already deadlocked (which is a negative in its own right, but is excluded for the sake of brevity).

Progression is tied to a skill tree, giving reason to the various pots containing currency. I am not personally a big fan of this approach, as it does not guarantee a consistent experience for all players involved. Fortunately none of the upgrades felt mandatory as the game is not particularly punishing even without them. The skill tree is little invasive towards the rest of the game and only pops up intermittently as the player finds another shrine to interact with. Upgrades themselves include either flat upgrades or cooldown bound abilities that achieve very little for the expressiveness of combat, rather adding a new toy to be used whenever available.

## The passionate side

While talking to one of the developers it was made clear to me Nocturnal is very much a learning experience for a comparatively young company (founded in 2013, [according to their own website](https://www.sunnysidegames.ch/pages/about-us)). This is strongly reflected in the final product. It starts off with a beautiful hand-drawn cinematic introduction and looks like a confident game. Unfortunately the game falls short in both gameplay and game design, feeling flat and unsurprising in its approach.

Yet the game does show a lot of passion, especially in the graphical department. The shader effects are beautiful, especially the fluid simulations used to convey the mist. The environmental design feels both scalable yet distinct and pretty while being diverse enough for the game's running time. And there are quite a few things Nocturnal deserves credit for even outside its presentation: the game achieves a good distinction between the "front layer" and the background, it features decent sound design across the board and makes good use of its bullet-time effect without being invasive whatsoever. But most of all Nocturnal feels like it achieves good *pacing*; at no stage during the game's short run-time did the game feel repetitive, frequently interweaving mechanically different challenges - ranging from combat, to platforming to fast, precise timed sections.

Unfortunately it just doesn't click together all that well and feels more like a product designed around a gimmick, as opposed to born to a well structured design plan.

## Conclusion

Nocturnal proves once again that looks can be deceiving, standing out as a pretty yet bland action platforming built upon a deeply flawed notion. Prominent issues with visual communication and feedback lie at the roots of its inconsistent experience, while being predominantly bland and unsurprising outside of them. The game's short running time is carried entirely by its pretty environs, shader effects and decent sound design.

**Verdict: 4/10 - "mediocre"**

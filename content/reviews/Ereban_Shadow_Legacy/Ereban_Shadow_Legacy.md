## Introduction

Ereban Shadow Legacy is a game developed by Baby Robot Games - a comparatively modestly sized team consisting of 7 people. It released on the 10th of April 2024 after having been teased on various occasions in the years prior. The game is developed in Unity. Ereban Shadow Legacy can be considered a spiritual successor to Baby Robot Games' earlier [Atlas' Fate](http://www.atlasfate.com/), which was developed 7 years prior as part of a masters programme. Similar to its predecessor the game has its own [dedicated website](https://www.ereban.com/) which currently doubles as the developers' homepage.

The game is a semi-linear stealth platformer leaning heavily on its primary gimmick: being able to traverse geometry by assuming the form of a shadow. It is similar to the [Aragami series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aragami_(video_game). The game has a modest runtime of around 3 to 5 hours.

Upon reception the game was met with good user reviews on Steam, albeit with a strikingly small pool of people to draw from - many of which received the game for free. At the time of writing the game sits at a 90% positive review rating. It was met with good albeit slightly more mixed critic reviews.

## Overshadowing gimmick

Ereban Shadow Legacy's premise relies heavily on its core gimmick: being able to traverse geometry enshrouded in shadows freely and unnoticed. Throughout the game's brief runtime the challenge will alternate crudely between weaving through swats of enemies or performing various platforming challenges - usually in one way or another related to shadows. At its most ingenious Ereban Shadow Legacy surprises, but the act quickly loses momentum as the game fails to expand upon it beyond a small repertoire of repeating tricks.

Worse yet is the fact that the gimmick seemed to have caused the developers to neglect other aspects of the gameplay. Platforming feels clunky and barebones, as does any form of interaction with enemies. It is in fact so underdeveloped that I doubt the game could even pass as a tech demo had it not been for its one saving grace. The freedom offered by being able to traverse geometry at will is extremely expressive and gives a lot of meaning to otherwise seemingly irrelevant surfaces. As a consequence the game is often quite blunt in limiting the player in using it, with odd static spotlights (often not even originating from a visible source), annoying ledges preventing you from climbing atop a platform or outright untraversable areas in the form of mossy growth. When the game takes a step back and lets the player scoot around to their heart's content any form of challenge unsurprisingly evaportes immediately. The result is a thoroughly inconsistent experience mostly relying on its platforming puzzles to pad playtime.

And even though the gimmick is both cool and works *most of the time* I still found myself getting stuck far too frequently. In the worst cases phasing through geometry entirely - which happened to me as many as three times in the first three levels alone.

## Inconsistently indie

Inconsistent would be the most accurate way to describe Ereban Shadow Legacy - a motif that reappears in every facet of the game. Many of the things Ereban seems to commit to feel like they could work but ultimately fail in mediocre or half-assed execution. Even though pleasing to the eye the game's initial, more open ended maps feel devoid of meaning. Enemy AI is too barebones to constitute any real opposition. The map design is mostly bland and linear. The game offers two skill-trees, one of which has barely any influence on the game and the other further trivializes an already easy game. The game offers skill-trees *at all*: further guaranteeing an inconsistent experience across players.

The enemy design is a definite low point: sporting an already scarce roster of hostiles the few variations we do see do very little to spice up gameplay in a meaningful way. But much, much worse is the AI that drives your mentally impaired opponents. Not a single enemy cannot be shaken by the good old "sit atop a crate"-strategy - assuming you have the wit to dodge the occasional projectile. Enemies do not coordinate in any meaningful way. Searching seems to consist of intensely staring down a wall at the opposite end of the room until patrol duty is resumed. As mentioned in the previous section it would be a big compliment to call any of it *passable*. Most striking to me is how little light is incorporated in the mix as well: for a game that is, quite literally, structured around contrasting light to darkness I would expect there to be more creativity on this front. Where are the bot controlled spotlights? The interactable light sources?

But for every thing Ereban Shadow Legacy does poorly there is an element of undeniable indie charm. With its hammy, predictable but somewhat endearing writing the game will not win any Pulitzer prizes - but it might just win the hearts of those recognizing the misguided passion that went into assembling it (especially once the game starts tapping into uninspired metaphors I couldn't help but smile). The voice acting is of a similar quality, with seemingly inexperienced voice actors and actresses delivering an inconsistent but sincere performance. Animations fall somewhere between passable and clunky, especially during dialogue sections where characters find themselves involunterarily tapdancing while awkwardly gesticulating. It radiates indie and there is no reason to feel shame in that.

This passion can too be found in the game's equally misguided visual design. Contrasting the inconsistent texture work of the environment to the odd, cell-shaded characters makes it all feel incoherent but not entirely unpleasant on the eye. Map design follows step with oddly elaborate yet mostly meaningless locations devoid of interaction. Enemy placement is equally strange, with unnecessarily long interludes of just running around - giving off a strong "artificial" feel to the otherwise logically connected segments.

## Conclusion

Ereban Shadow Legacy feels like a game designed around a gimmick, and despite it being a neat one it cannot save an otherwise highly inconsistent, bland experience. With its extremely bare bones stealth game implementation, exceptionally boring level design, terrible AI and frustrating clunkiness Baby Robot Games' commercial debut title is no homerun. But it does propagate the indie experience with its striking albeit incoherent and flawed looks, decent voice acting, terrible yet endearing writing and the clear amount of love that went into creating it (do take a look at [their beautiful website](https://www.ereban.com/) for example!). If anything Ereban Shadow Legacy is a testament to a talented team learning the craft.

**Verdict: 5/10 - "average"**

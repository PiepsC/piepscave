## Introduction

RUINER is an game developed by Reikon games, a very small studio based in Poland existing of industry veterans. It released in 2017 for Windows, Linux, Xbox and the PS4. 2 and a half years later it released on the Nintendo Switch. It is published by Devolver Digital, effectively earning it the title of *indie*. The engine used is the Unreal Engine 4.

The game is a Twin-Stick action-focused (i.e. little fluff outside the core gameplay) game, clearly taking inspiration from influential games like Hotline Miami. The setting is, once again, cyberpunk influenced, as many indie games were around this time. Addiction, manipulation and perseverance are clear motifs throughout the game. RUINER sports a gritty, somewhat raunchy undertone. Its difficulty is one of its spearheads; being brutally unforgiving but allowing the player to jump right back in and try again.

## More cyberpunk

RUINER released in 2017, which will go down as the peak of the *cyberpunk craze* for developers. As such its themes are little surprising, even though the game does a good job at carving out its own identity. You can't escape the not-particularly-subtle motifs of manipulation and addiction even if you would try. KILL BOSS. KILL YOU. TRY AGAIN. It's crude and heavy-handed at the best of times, but also unique and *slightly* discomforting.

On top of its distinct lack of subtlety RUINER features some amazing hand-drawn artwork. Most prominently of SHE; your guiding light and advisor. SHE is portrayed in a way that puts her square in-line with the tone of the game; designed to be edgy yet desirable. SHE will push you to continue throughout the game, rewarding you with compliments if you do well and scolding you when not performing up to par. All while referring to you as "Puppy". Without spoiling much about the plot: it's not subtle. RUINER doesn't do that.

Much of the game's aesthetics are simple, sporting very minimal texturing work and little clutter. This makes distinguishing the foreground from the irrelevant much easier and feels at least partially deliberate (even though also clearly a consequence of Reikon's very modest employee count). There are a few different environs which differ little in appearance from arena to arena. Boss fights are a little flashier. The game also has a hub area (ugh) which is much more fleshed out, suddenly going into an unnecessary amount of detail - as if to compensate for the aforementioned levels. Unfortunately I hate hub areas in any game, so much of the detail is lost on me.

The sound design is pretty good if not a little unremarkable. The voice acting is passable (I have to admit I'm no big fan of SHE's voice actor). The music is unique, being a combination of your typical sci-fi sounds combined with distinctly dirty, urban samples and vocals. It compliments the setting well.

## Try again

RUINER's premise is very simple, and those already familiar with similar titles such as Hotline Miami will feel right at home. The challenge is segmented into levels, which in turn are cut-up in various checkpoints. Navigating between checkpoints either constitutes surviving a corridor leading to an arena or the latter (sometimes both). Arenas are the focal point and consist of besting waves of enemies in an enclosed area. The game has a tendency to throw *just a bit more* at you than you can handle upon your initial try, usually forcing you to retry at least once or twice. In the worst cases a multitude of times - but I found this to be quite rare. Having to retry multiple times per arena *per mission* does eventually add up to a significant toll - and this is exactly what RUINER is all about. You restart, you try again. The game feels snappy and deliberate, often teetering on the brink of being within your current competence, but slightly beyond. In case this strategy fails it also offers a *pity prize* for those stuck; rewarding you with additional *Karma* for dying too often. Ow, my ego!

Karma is used as a currency to purchase upgrades. I have to admit that this is the weakest intentional part of the game for me, and seems to go somewhat against the overarching themes the game is clearly designed around. RUINER offers a *skill-tree* like structure which can be reassigned *freely* at any time. This allows you to experiment with various setups, ranging from being able to "hack" enemies for a brief period of time or spawning stationary shields to simply increasing some of your stats. The more fundamental mechanics are explained in the tutorial - including your dash- and shield abilities (not the stationary shield - confusingly RUINER offers two options here). Even after trying everything I found myself just investing in the more essential sub-trees, if only to keep the game more concise and *elegant*.

The actual core loop consists of alternating between your ranged weapon and your melee weapon. Both of which can be obtained ad hoc *during* an arena, or right before and after. Weapons abide by a straightforward durability mechanic; ammo's empty or the durability has depleted? Your weapon is out, and you automatically revert back to the default. All of this is again very deliberate and makes the game feel more dynamic despite its inherent repetitiveness.

My favorite mechanic in RUINER is without a doubt the way it implements the dash: not only can you dash immediately in the direction of your current input, you can also *choose* what waypoint to dash to by clicking it on the geometry. When a waypoint is reached the player gets access to a brief respite in the form of additional bullet-time, allowing you to make a decision based on the circumstances as they are upon arrival. It's a near flawless and incredibly smart system that offers a high skill ceiling while still being easy to understand - playing perfectly into the game's pacing.

## The responsibility of difficulty

As I have stated on various occasions I don't think there is anything wrong with making a game especially hard or punishing, but doing so should significantly raises the responsibilities for the developer. If you want to make a game rely on tight execution the windows in which the player is to act can't be ambiguous - they need to be communicated very clearly. It also needs to make sure there is an alternative path if players do truly get stuck. Preferably the game would also make the difficulty scale up gradually and in an understandable fashion. Overall I would say RUINER does *decent* at respecting these tasks.

It certainly nails the gradual increase in difficulty; being quite easy when the player is just getting acclimated, but much more punishing once the game figures the ball has started rolling. Throughout the entire game did I find myself dying once or twice per arena consistently - with some (much) higher outliers during the boss-fights. A pretty remarkable feat. Unfortunately I don't think the game executes visual communication quite as well - too frequently using overlapping color palettes or making enemies too hard to keep track of. This seems like a bad compromise to achieve the game's signature "red on grey"-look. Especially during the later stages of the game I found myself suddenly dying to enemies I had not seen sneak up to me. RUINER does not incorporate visual ambiguity as a deliberate mechanic (or if the designers would claim it does, then very poorly) so this is a definite negative for me.

Another issue I found with the game is that sometimes it feels a bit too *random*; enemies seem to dash and move around based on some randomized internal timer. This frequently lead to inconsistent situations where I felt I should be rewarded for a clean execution, but instead got punished - seemingly arbitrary. One such occasion is when an enemy decides to suddenly dash, then backstrafe after I decided to jump on top of them. This would result in me taking damage despite *usually* being rewarded with a kill. Luckily the game is lenient enough to take a few of these hits even on the hardest difficulty, but such inconsistencies feel like they should be avoided in a game that prides itself with being hard.

## Conclusion

RUINER is as deliberate as it is short, delivering on its premise with ease and style. The game does suffer from being a little more bloated than I had hoped it would be, but due to the way this is implemented it is a comparatively minor inconvenience. Carving out a distinct niche within the oversaturated market of cyberpunk products it is a memorable title. It's hard, but quite fair and seems to be designed to push you just a bit further at every second attempt. Even though most issues I take with RUINER are comparatively minor, they do add up to a product that could have used *just a little* longer in the oven.

Overall one of the strongest, most confident indie titles released in 2017 and definitely worth the purchase. I will be looking forward to Reikon Games' new endeavors.

**Verdict: 8/10 - "great"**

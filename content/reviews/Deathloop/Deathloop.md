## Introduction
Deathloop was a highly anticipated game released by the renowned Arkane studios, in particular their Lyon based branch. It released in September of 2021 on Windows and the PS5 console, and on Xbox a year later. Subjected to a pretty extensive marketing campaign we have seen the game director Dinga Bakaba appear in quite a few interviews prior to its release. The game offers a unique "integrated" multiplayer experience and relies on the protagonist, Colt, to unveil Blackreef's secrets by replaying the same day over and over. Its novelty was a big spearhead in the marketing campaign. The game was developed with the proprietary in-house Void Engine. Deathloop is considered a part of the Dishonored series and takes strong inspiration from the latter. Deathloop was one of the highest rated games ever by critics upon reception, receiving several *perfect* marks, [including one from IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/deathloop-review).

## The premise
Deathloop is a very bold game in terms of its design. In retrospect probably *a little* arrogant too. In various interviews with Dinga the idea is propagated Deathloop would be a more *focused* experience than previous Dishonored titles. In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ra-jkrurR4) by Noclip he explains that he and other designers found fault with the way the Dishonored games were being played; rather than just mucking about and proceeding at their own pace players would fall victim to self-doubt: "do I approach this situation as intended?"/"is this what the game was designed around?". Deathloop was specifically designed to allow people to explore all angles, then optimize it upon repetition. It is also stated several times it was one of the most aggressively re-designed games Arkane has ever produced (i.e. mutating mid development).

The "murder mystery" aspect was implemented in a very *hand-holding* way; being explained away by otherwise "cognitively overloading" (these are Dinga's words) the player with too much information. This hand-holding is aggressively implemented in Deathloop, often offering the player little to no freedom to interpret what information they just gathered. Instead of connecting the dots themselves all they have to do is click the appropriate lit up button in the menu and have a quest marker appear to send them in the right direction. It is safe to assume whatever play-testers are referred to in the interviews would most likely end up in a comatose state frying their neurons playing Clue.

Since there appears to be an overarching narrative conflict between Colt and Julianna, one trying to break the loop and the other trying to maintain it, there is also Deathloop's multiplayer aspect. Multiplayer assumes the form of an invasion. Upon Julianna entering Colt's game the latter is locked in the current map, needing to first hack a stationary beacon in order to flee. Alternatively Colt can just kill Julianna to achieve the same effect. Invasions occur at random, and can be facilitated either by public matchmaking or, in case the latter is disabled an NPC.

The setting is inspired by a sixties aesthetic gone alternative. With quirky weapons, coherently themed UI inspired by 60s colorful yet clean lines and an admittedly fun environmental design Deathloop is pleasant on the eyes. Unfortunately these is the only things the game delivers without needing to be tagged with a multitude of asterisks.

## The Dishonored magic
Arkane has an eye for quality, there are few people who will question this. However, Deathloop and its many pre-release interviews with the designer conclusively prove to me a main ingredient in achieving *the Dishonored magic* was sheer, stupid luck. For those unaware: Dishonored is a series where the protagonist, Corvo, assumes the role of a paranormal assassin. The associated, hilariously broken tactical tools the player gets access to allow you to approach any situation from a near infinite amount of angles. The stellar level design strongly enhances this effect, offering a great deal of verticality and hidden passages. Just going from A to B was not enough for a lot of players - instead desiring to complete missions in the most elaborate way imaginable. But even those not willing to invest the time got to experience some of this glory, simply due to how accessible and overpowered the available tools were combined with the elaborate, secret ridden levels.

But Dishonored was never *explicitly designed* to be played this way, as admitted by the designers themselves. As Dinga explains the developers felt heartbroken by seeing people assume the game's original intentions (being more stealth oriented) were not "the right way to play". When examining Dishonored's design large strides of the game, most notably the *chaos system* go directly against the concept of the ludicrous amount of player freedom we see elsewhere. The developers [have stated on various occasions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfJegMhKPh8) (this whole video is excellent, but the part in question is named roughly around the 13 minute mark) that the intended design was more more *rigid* than what players interpreted. A great deal of Dishonored's charm was *unintentional*.

So given the opportunity to learn from previously successful titles, why did Deathloop fail so badly from both a financial and design standpoint?

## Arkane's disconnect
As Dinga stated several times the intention with Deathloop was to *innately* offer the opportunity for the "confused" players to catch up to those pulling off all the insane tricks Dishonored is now known for. This would gradually increase their confidence, starting out with a more stealth oriented approach but ultimately emerging as the unstoppable killing machine they were meant to be all along. Unfortunately neither Dinga, nor any of the other designers or playtesters seemed to realize that if you force a player to partake in repeating the same mission over and over it actually needs to facilitate that drive to improve Dishonored stumbled upon by sheer accident. Instead Deathloop is *more restricted* than Dishonored in right about every imaginable way: fewer powers, fewer upgrades, fewer hidden passageways and enemies less threatening than a dying mosquito with both wings clipped. **"We will just let them repeat the same thing over and over again and surely the drive to continue will just magically appear as it did in previous games!"** seemed to be a completely valid and reasonable premise to build from according to Dinga and his team of equally genius designers.

Instead of learning and trying to understand what made previous installments in the franchise such a cult classic they just assumed it would infuse the game by just being. They are *Arkane* after all! Unsurprisingly it did not. Deathloop suffers all the problems Dishonored struggled with but pretends it can just coast of the games' success as if they never existed. Enemies pose no threat to the player at any stage, making completing objectives a complete casual jog in the park. Only this time you get to do it 10 times over, effectively also invalidating the fun of finding alternative hidden passageways the more casual players could enjoy in the original titles. This caters to neither the hardcore fans, who will want to redo missions *after* having all tools available to them, nor casual players - who are in effect pretty much just repeating the same thing over and over, albeit with an additional tool.

For Deathloop to deliver on its premise it would need to be *way more punishing*, *way harder* on the player, and actually make progression make sense. Make enemy encounters brutal and force the player to try various strategies to make it out alive. *"I barely made it this far, I will need to invent a more efficient approach if I am to make it further"*. This effect would also justify the way the game opens up options in a gradual fashion. The game feels like it is trivially solved without even needing to try despite explicitly incorporating a game mechanic that forces you to learn in a very heavy handed way. The second time you ask me what "2+2" is my answer is not going to be any different.

So instead of running with the wild successes of previous games Arkane somehow managed to completely misunderstand their audience and release a *worse* version of Dishonored. But at least it comes with loads of pretentious interviews that feel more like lost episodes of *The Office* in retrospect.

## Clue for the mentally impaired
As I mentioned in an earlier section the designers explicitly opted to hold the hand of the player throughout the game. After all, connecting the dots themselves would surely *cognitively overload* them. To achieve this all clues, notes and connections are captured in a menu. This menu will also constitute approximately half of your playtime. You pick up the 20th note you can't be bothered to read and if, by sheer luck, it contains vital information it will appear in your all-encompassing miracle-menu. If it is a safe- or keypad code fret not, the protagonist will tell you the answer when you are within reach. How is that for accessibility? Deathloop is the first game designed to take away the nuisance of having to actually play it.

And these clues will pile up. And the more they do, the less you care. Adding a bunch of fragmented logs to read between having to repeat the same level for the third time hardly constitutes a proper way to change the pace. And really, why would I? Just follow the constant quest markers on the screen!

## Julianna has disconnected
Another prominent facet of Deathloop is its multiplayer aspect. Julianna and Colt have a history, as the game will gladly slap you across the face with through terrible, hammy and predictable dialogue. Because the only thing Deathloop was missing is a nice little sprinkle of Marvel writing seasoning. ["Did I just do that?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zo3jPUPbeI){:target="_blank"}

Julianna is a proponent to *the loop*'s existence, and Colt wants to end it. Conflict ensues.

## Conclusion
Deathloop is an anomaly and one of the most poorly designed triple A games I have ever seen. Looking back at it now it perfectly set the stage for Arkane's next homerun: [RedFall](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294810/Redfall/).

Spawned by what appears to be pure misguided arrogance Deathloop recognizes the runaway success they experienced with the Dishonored, but completely failed to capture its essence. Despite being visually pleasant, sporting good voice acting (albeit with awful Marvel-like dialogue), a creative story and vaguely mimicking some of the previous games' charm it is utterly overshadowed by its utterly broken premise.

**Verdict: 3/10 - "bad"**

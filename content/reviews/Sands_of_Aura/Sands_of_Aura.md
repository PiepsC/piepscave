## Introduction
Sands of Aura is an ambitious action RPG inspired by the souls franchise. It was developed by a Chashu Entertainment, a comparatively modest team consisting of 12 people based in Texas. It released in 2023 after having been in Early Access for two years. Prior to releasing into Early Access the game had been in development for an additional three years. The engine of choice is the Unreal Engine 4. Sands of Aura enjoyed a mostly positive reception on launch and gained only a modest amount of traction over the span of its existence. It flew under the radar of most major gaming outlets.

## Another souls-like
Sands of Aura prides itself in being a *"souls-like"* - an immediate red flag for people aware of the consequences of the franchise on small scale indie productions. And even though the inspiration of Miyazaki's works is evident in many facets of the game, I think Sands of Aura might have benefitted from a bit more confidence. The game does not *need* to deliberately place itself in the shadow of giants - it is a noteworthy product entirely by itself.

The Soulsbornes are games known for excessive weaponizing of inaccessibility (to the point of cruelty, in Miyazaki's own words) and being exceptionally punishing. Sands of Aura is punishing and at times outright unfair, but does embrace most of the fundamental design responsibilities such as visual communication, a consistent and smooth learning curve and tutorialization where necessary. This works in the game's favor, as I have yet to find offspawn from the legendary series that benefitted from the deliberate decision to forego the basic building blocks on account of "being a souls inspired game". In fact, Sands of Aura *improves* on its inspiration in many ways. Difficulty wise the game is more consistent - being only moderately hard to execute but quite punishing towards failure.

Compared to most ARPGs Sands of Aura prefers execution over theory crafting - sporting a modest but impressively sharp toolset of mechanics. Rather than obtaining a particularly broken build to doze through hordes of faceless enemies, the player is expected to execute their approach properly or suffer the consequences. To this end they are equipped with six fundamental mechanics: movement (including a basic combat roll sporting familiar invulnerability frames), blocking, the basic attack chains, spellblade attacks, special attacks and their Estus flask... I mean *Testament Bell*. There is little fat to the way Sands of Aura approaches combat, and once again this works into its favor - instead relying on the game to flow dynamically through enemy design as opposed to continuously exposing the player to new mechanics. Weapon "character" is expressed primarily through their attack chains - allowing for variations in range, speed and consequently spacing. Upon inflicting damage towards hostiles the player generates a resource referred to as *corruption*; corruption is utilized to perform special attacks. Special attacks inflict a high amount of stagger and damage to enemies susceptible. On top of this activating special attacks regenerates pips of *spellblade* - a one time use buff that can be applied to enhance any of the three most basic inputs: your combat roll, your next attack or even your block. The result is a *highly* dynamic and natural flow to combat, where the player is expected to interweave ad hoc decisions through their spellblade activation, which in turn allows them to get back into the fray - allowing them to execute highly damaging special moves before beginning the cycle anew. It is without a doubt **one of the most clean and intelligent approaches to ARPG combat I have ever come across**.

## The responsibility of accessibility

Games proclaiming to be inspired by the souls franchise tend to frighten me. Not because they are hard or punishing, but rather because developers tend to interpret it as being able to freely waive the need for accessibility. Accessibility continues to be one of the most *underappreciated* design fundamentals in modern game design, being only consistently present in most triple A productions (which suffer many other issues in turn). Under the broad spectrum of features considered as such falls the need to communicate with the audience what the game's intent is; *why* did they end up in the failstate? *How* do the mechanics works? *In what way are they supposed to interact with the product*?

Fortunately Sands of Aura does do quite well even on this front, albeit somewhat inconsistently. At its best the game makes its intentions abundantly clear, once again in a very elegant, minimal approach: when enemies are struck repeatedly they may become "Unstoppable"; indicated by a bold, highly contrasting purple color. This is the player's sign they might have just lost the initiative, and can no longer rely on their weapons' innate staggering ability to take it back. Enemies can and will continue their attacks even upon being struck. This is an incredibly clear means of communicating to the player it might be wise to either back up, or proactively try to take back the ability to safely attack. The game offers *both* options - the latter through the parry mechanic. The parry mechanic is similar to the soulsbornes (blocking right before impact), but implemented much more leniently. Upon successfully parrying an opponent they are stunned, indicated by a highly contrasting yellow color. This implementation is much smarter than you might initially give it credit for, as the natural flow of combat *builds the confidence* in players to commit to such a bold move (when losing initiative the cautious player will back up, allowing them to observe enemy attacks). Lastly enemies may enter a *blocking state* - indicated by a blue color similar to the player's shield. This can be broken by striking said enemy with a special attack. When everything works the player has little reason to ever be confused about what they are supposed to do or what they did wrong upon occasional failure. It also offers the game to distinctly express fodder from *"quality"* hostiles, as the former can be effectively suppressed as long as the player keeps up the pressure.

The game cannot and does not always rely on this system. Bosses, usually found separated in enclosed boss-rooms, decide the pace of combat almost entirely - outside of the occasional opportunity to parry their attacks. This makes perfect sense from the perspective of the intended challenge. Unfortunately the game foregoes the same communication for specific enemy types - which cannot be staggered entirely. This provides a perfect juxtaposition to its own implementation. The player may, upon being met with these specific enemies, suddenly die to incorrectly reading the initial few frames of some arbitrary animation (very similar to the soulsbornes of course). Even for the sake of challenge this was an admittedly disappointing discovery in a game that otherwise does such a good job at communicating.

One of Sands of Aura's biggest victories in achieving accessibility is the simple choice of opting for a top-down camera. In many first or third person games visual ambiguity is a consequence of the player's lacking situational awareness. Be honest, how many times did you politely ask your monitor "how did that still hit me?" while playing Dark Souls or Elden Ring? This especially pays dividend during the plethora of boss-fights - giving the player plenty of feedback on the spatial dimensions of the many attacks thrown at them. And the game does not even sacrifice the jump functionality to achieve this - which is even utilized surprisingly well on various occasions.

## A buried collection of dungeons and loot

Sands of Aura segments itself in various *islands* - self contained dungeons commonly built around a specific theme or gimmick. To reach aforementioned dungeons the player is meant to traverse an expansive but empty desert using their trusty skiff *Grainwake*. This is quite similar to older Carmack games like *Rage*; utilizing a vehicle to give the player a sense of scale and break with the usual monotony of combat. Rather than combat these sections are vaguely justified through sporadic commentary from your accompanying lookout and obtainable drifting goods. It's not engaging in the slightest, nor does the ship handle interestingly - but in the end these sections are rather inoffensive. Especially considering the player is allowed to fast-travel to destinations discovered prior.

The dungeons themselves are oozing with personality, ranging from simple, short platforming sections to large, imposing multilayered forts. The game makes *extraordinary* use of verticality in its map design and most are riddled with well placed secrets. If one thing Miyazaki has spoiled us with it is excellent, overly intricate level design, and Sands of Aura does its inspiration honor. Out of all ARPGs I can readily recall Sands of Aura has the most impressive and effortlessly diverse dungeon design. This effect is strongly enhanced by the large array of different assets decorating said dungeons and each having their own unique set of hostiles (albeit often derived from earlier variations - which I actually like for the sake of gameplay consistency).

Equipment in Sands of Aura assumes a creative form too, opting instead for *weapon permutations* similar to *Lies of P* as opposed to individually unique weapons. The player is able to combine their own weapon around their playstyle preference - being able to customize the fighting style, weapon head, pommel and additional enhancement. The fighting style determines the basic attack chain and most fundamental modifier, whereas the weapon head its range, damage and speed. The pommel and enhancement (referred to as *Codices*) add specific bonuses and can be found strewn across the dungeons. Even though this sounds unnecessary convoluted, it does actually offer a decent handle on the designer's ability to balance weapons - while still offering a great deal of expressiveness and loot for the player to toy around with. Armors are composed of four different pieces, offering a unique bonus upon equipping all pieces of the same set (or a diminished effect in case at least half the set is worn). Full armor sets can be found scattered across the same dungeon, offering the player incentive to investigate all tangents. Even though the implementation of scaling and armor effects is fun at first glance, I fear it might be invasive towards a consistent experience across players - offering the ability to wildly alter an already comparatively concise gameplay loop.

## Conclusion
Sands of Aura is unfortunate proof one ingredient of success is dumb luck - being an extraordinary indie title deserving a tenfold the love it received. With its quirky *Burton-eseque* character design, good animation work and positively astounding level design the game proves it has the looks. While adhering to fundamental design principles, sporting snappy responsive combat and innovative yet well implemented underlying mechanics prove it has the substance too. The game is held back only slightly by the occasional lack of production quality and consistently shining through, especially in the SFX department and enemy design.

One of the most remarkable and underappreciated indie titles released last year.

**Verdict: 8/10 - "great"**

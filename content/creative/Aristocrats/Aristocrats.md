## Introduction

Aristocrats is a party game that can be played with a regular deck of cards. It was originally designed around 3 players, but can easily be played with up to 5 people. The game is called "Aristocrats" after the typical thinly veiled egotistical and decadent attitude of the Victorian high society members as depicted in novels by Oscar Wilde. In Aristocrats people will be interacting with one another by pretending to be courteous, while in reality just trying to advance their own goals. The game is played in different *rounds*, which usually resolve fairly quickly. In order to play one would need to keep track of each player's individual score, similar to other common card games like Hearts. The person ending with the highest score wins!

## Rationale

The game was designed around a classical card deck while providing a snappy experience with *higher player interactivity*. After all: the most fun to be had with good company is to be able to bully them into submission right (right...?)? Most rounds will not last long and do not require prior experience to properly partake in. Games will usually close out quite rapidly after one or two players lock in their cards as the remainder of the players will be tossed into the classical *prisoners' dilemma* ("do we keep playing or will the opponent lock in, ruining my hand?"). Luck plays a significant role in obtaining the most desirable hand, but unusual outliers will usually flatten out over the comparatively high frequency of rounds. Even though I would recommend playing around with the game's rules to fit your company's needs, I do as such advise to not cut the amount rounds too short (lest you want someone to win through sheer luck).

## The goal

The goal in Aristocrats is to complete a sequence of an identical suit. Similar to e.g. a *flush* in Poker. Any cards that remain in the player's hand that does not contribute to the sequence will be counted as a **negative contribution**. Cards are scored according to a simple ascending metric: the Jack represents 11 points, the Queen 12 and the King 13 - all others cards are scored according to their value. The Ace functions as both a Joker when scoring and *the highest card* when it comes to trading (this will be explained later). When completing a sequence **an Ace of any color** can be used to substitute **any** missing card. In this case the Ace will assume the score of the card it is substituting. The Ace *does not count as 14 points* in the regular ascending scoring! An example is provided below with someone having managed to obtain a sequence of length four, but one disconnected card.

Since the Ace always functions like a Joker it will assume the *Jack of Hearts*. Thus, this hand is worth a total of 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 - 4 points. Totaling at a score of 34. The highest score a player could possibly obtain is 13 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 9, or 55 in total. This sequence can be completed in 21 ways when considering Aces.

## Playing Aristocrats

Each player is dealt 5 cards at random which they keep secret from everyone else. The remainder of the deck is placed at the center of the board face-down. The top card of this deck is flipped face-up and placed on top of the stack. This card is available to everyone during their turn and will be **discarded** upon surviving a full round (i.e. a person gets access to it *for a second time* during their turn). Discarded cards are removed from the current round entirely. The **oldest player** in the company starts the game.

The starting player may either *donate* a card to any other player or *take* the currently unveiled card. When taking the card from the deck this player must discard any one card from their hand, **including the option of discarding the card they just collected**. It is not revealed to other players what card is discarded. After having done so this player takes the top card from the deck and flips it upside down, placing it back on top of the deck. This constitutes their *first action*. The first action may be forfeit if the player so wishes. For their *second action* they may either: forfeit this action (i.e. continue playing), *lock in* their cards or *steal ALL CARDS from another player, replacing theirs with yours*. In case of the latter two options the player places their cards face-down in front of them. Exchanged cards after a swap must be transferred face-down. They can no longer partake in this round and can no longer receive gifts. For additional comical effect there is the optional rule of disallowing the player initiating a transfer to look at the cards they received.

When gifting a card to another player this card is transferred to them face-down, disallowing other players to see. The person receiving the gift may look at the card they just received. In case they can, they **must** accept this gift and return a card from their hand that is of a **strictly higher value, of a different suit than the one received**. When receiving a gift an Ace counts as 14 points, implying it outvalues the King. **The suit of the Ace is considered when picking a gift to return.** In case of multiple options the recipient may freely choose what card to return. The resulting card is transferred face-down back to the donor. If the receiving player has no single option they must declare this to the entire company and return the original card to the donor face-down. The person that initiated the gift will immediately forfeit their turn (i.e. lose their second action). In case the recipient does return another card the donor receives the token of *Benefactor*. The Benefactor holds the chosen token, usually a Joker card, next to them, visible to all. The Benefactor **can not receive gifts from anyone else**. A player holding the title of Benefactor can lose it in various ways: someone else completes a gift, transferring the title to them, the current Benefactor has their gift *denied* (i.e. the recipient cannot return a higher card) or they opt to take the unveiled card from the deck. Naturally they also lose the title when locking in their cards. There is at most one Benefactor at a time.

The game consists of at least 6 rounds, following the usual convention of 2 rounds per player. This may however last much too long with a larger company (10 rounds with 5 players!), so it might be better to agree on fewer rounds for brevity's sake. Do not forget to shuffle the cards after the end of each round!

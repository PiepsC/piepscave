# A Simple Homomorphic Obfuscation Scheme Over Automorphisms

**Abstract:** Homomorphic encryption was long considered the holy grail of public encryption but was widely thought unobtainable. Being first theorized to exist by Rivest, Adleman, and Dertouzos in 1978 after observing the homomorphic properties of RSA, homomorphic encryption refers to a class of encryption methods capable of evaluating arbitrary boolean circuits on ciphertexts as if the operations were applied to the plaintext directly. Since being conceptually conceived the academic community has been hard at work trying to find a bounded, secure implementation. In 2009 Craig Gentry was the first to produce such a model, albeit not very practical yet. This opened the floodgates and various research departments from prominent tech companies sought to find an all-encapsulating solution, yielding large libraries such as Microsoft SEAL and HElib. Unfortunately, these solutions are largely based on variations of LWE (Learning With Error) due to investing in being quantum secure, making them difficult to apply in real-life situations. Simpler homomorphic schemes do exist but havenâ€™t been the target of recent research. The goal of this thesis is to attack the problem from the angle of performance first and foremost. Would it be possible to find a homomorphic encryption scheme that we know abides by strict overhead limitations?

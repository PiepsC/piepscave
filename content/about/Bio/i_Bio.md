# Contact information

**Note:** if you feel inclined to contact me, please use the appropriate medium! If you need to contact me with regard to any of the courses I teach or taught in the past, do so through my *university mail* or approach the student assistants first. I do not like to be called directly unless it is urgent. I am quite active on matrix and frequently read my e-mail. In case of work related questions contact the department secretary.
